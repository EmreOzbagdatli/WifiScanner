# WifiScanner App
WifiScanner is a mobile application developed using SwiftUI that allows users to scan and view WiFi network information and save their scanned data for future reference. The app is designed for simplicity and ease of use, and it is intentionally kept lightweight due to its small scope.

# Features

- Save scanned WiFi data to UserDefaults for easy access and reference.

# Technical Details
- Developed using SwiftUI, Apple's modern UI framework.
- The app is intentionally designed without a specific design pattern due to its small size and simplicity.

Note: Since I do not have a developer account, I do not have access to network information, so the SSID and BSSID return false. But if you download it to your own computer, it will work.
